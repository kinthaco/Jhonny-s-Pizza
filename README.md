This project transforms the intuition-based decision-making process of a restaurant into a data-driven approach to support their scaling journey.

**Goal**: 

As a business grows, it evolves beyond daily operations and starts leveraging data to drive strategic initiatives, optimize performance, and uncover new growth opportunities. The goal is to turn intuition-based choices into data-driven strategies that help optimize areas like staffing, customer experience, marketing, and inventory management, ultimately supporting sustainable growth and profitability for the restaurant.

**Process**: 

By replacing intuition-based decisions with actionable insights, the restaurant can streamline staffing, marketing, inventory, and customer experience management.
